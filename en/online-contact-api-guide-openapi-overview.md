### API Certification Method Description
#### Security Key
##### Organization level
Each organization created in TOAST CONSOLE has its only security key. The security key enables encryption of data sent by the API and enables calling Open API related to organizational management. (register service, edit service, delete service, etc.) You could check organization level security key by Global Management → SSO Login → API Key menu.

##### Service Level
You can create multiple services in one organization and each service has its only security key. The security key enables encryption of data sent by the API and enables calling Open API related to service management. (Ticket management, FAQ, etc.) You could add service by add service API (/openapi/v1/admin/service/add.json), and after adding service, you could view service level security key from the returned response value. Also, you could check the security key by accessing into the service’s Online Contact, and click Service Management → OPEN API → API Key menu.

##### Response Body
```
{
    "header":{
        "resultCode":200,
        "resultMessage":"",
        "isSuccessful":true
    },
    "result":{
        "content":{
            "serviceId":"GameBaseService",
            "name":"GameBaseServiceAPI",
            "active":true,
            "language":"ko",
            "timeZone":"Asia/Seoul",
            "createdDt":1586745222442,
            "updatedDt":1586745222442,
            "securityKey":"cfdc25cc7ef54759ad29e6345213f2ed"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Authorization Header
You should set the following values to each request header.
- Authorization： Authentication string generated by the security key
- X-TC-Timestamp：Current UTC time value {new Date().getTime()}
- OUCODE：User code（ Not required, default value is Owner if not set）

#### To create an authorization string
You could create authorization string through encrypting by HmacSHA256, or encrypting (Organization ID + request URI + parameter value + Current UTC time value）string.

##### Java Example
```
String URL = "http://nhn-cs.alpha-oc.toast.com/openapi/v1/admin/service/add.json";
String organizationId = "WopqM8euoYw89B7i"; // Organization ID
String securityKey = "0983e74b682b416684d2da59347aec82"; // Organization API Key
String uri = "/openapi/v1/admin/service/add.json"; // request uri
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append(organizationId);
sb.append(uri);
sb.append("GameBaseService").append("&").append("GameBaseServiceAPI").append("&").append("ko").append("&").append("Asia/Seoul");// Parameter values are in name ascending order, and are separated by &
Date date = new Date();
sb.append(date.getTime());
SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(securityKey.getBytes("UTF-8"), "HmacSHA256");
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(signingKey.getAlgorithm());
mac.init(signingKey);
byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(sb.toString().getBytes("UTF-8"));
String authorization = new String(Base64.encodeBase64(rawHmac));
```

- Add body string after parameter when request body exists
- When attaching file, add MD5 of the file to the authentication string as parameter value
- Security Key
  - When using /openapi/v1/admin/* type of API, Use organization level security key
  - When using {serviceId}/openapi/v1/* type of API, Use service level security key
